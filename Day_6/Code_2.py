# Variable Practice Question 4
# Declare two variables as a and b. Initialize the values to those variables as 1042 and 7 respectively.

# Declare another two variables quo and rem that will store the quotient and remainder of these numbers taking a as dividend and b as divisor.

# Print quo and rem in a line separated by a space.

# Input Format
# No input. User has to declare the variables themselves.

# Output Format
# Print the quotient and remainder of these numbers by taking a as dividend and b as divisor.

# Output:

# 148 6
